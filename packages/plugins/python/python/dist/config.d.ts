/**
 * @description This plugin generates the base Python types, based on your GraphQL schema.
 *
 * This is equivalent of the `typescript` plugin. The generated types are simple, refer to your schema's exact structure, and will be used as the base type for future plugins (such as `python-operations`).
 *
 * By default, this package only supports Python 3.8+, since that is the first time literal types were introduced. If you do need support for Python 3.5-3.7, you'll need to use the typenameAsString option.
 *
 * @example
 * ```python
 * from generated_types import MyType
 * # ...
 * def fetchObject() -> MyType
 *    # ...
 *
 * a = fetchObject()
 * # Python will now provide type annotations for your object
 * ```
